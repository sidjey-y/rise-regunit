# How to Exit the Face Recognition Camera Application

## Exit Methods (Multiple Options Available)

### 1. **Keyboard Controls (Recommended)**
- **Press `Q`** - Quit the application
- **Press `ESC`** - Quit the application  
- **Press `q`** - Quit the application (lowercase also works)

### 2. **Force Quit with Ctrl+C**
- **Press `Ctrl+C`** in the terminal/command prompt
- This will force quit the application if keyboard controls don't work

### 3. **Close Window Manually**
- **Click the X button** on the camera window
- This will automatically shut down the camera

### 4. **Other Controls Available**
- **Press `F`** - Toggle fullscreen mode
- **Press `R`** - Reset liveness detection
- **Press `A`** - Approve photo (during review phase)

## Troubleshooting Exit Issues

### If you cannot exit with Q/ESC:
1. **Try pressing the key multiple times** - sometimes it takes a moment to register
2. **Make sure the camera window is focused** - click on the camera window first
3. **Use Ctrl+C in the terminal** - this is the most reliable method
4. **Close the window manually** - click the X button

### If the application seems frozen:
1. **Press Ctrl+C** in the terminal multiple times
2. **Close the terminal window** - this will force kill the process
3. **Use Task Manager** (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) to end the Python process

## Technical Details

The application has been improved with:
- **Better key detection** - increased waitKey delay from 1ms to 30ms
- **Multiple exit keys** - Q, q, ESC all work
- **Signal handling** - Ctrl+C is properly handled
- **Window close detection** - automatically exits if window is closed
- **Robust cleanup** - ensures camera resources are properly released

## Testing Exit Functionality

To test if exit works properly, run:
```bash
python test_exit.py
```

This will open the camera for 10 seconds and test the exit functionality.

## Still Having Issues?

If you continue to have problems exiting:
1. Check if your keyboard is working properly
2. Try running in windowed mode instead of fullscreen
3. Report the issue with details about your system
